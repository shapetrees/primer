# Shape Trees Primer

This repository contains the Primer for the [Shape Trees Specification](https://shapetrees.org/TR/specification/).

Shape trees marry RDF vocabularies, shapes, and resources into "little trees"
that provide machine to machine interoperability, combining them into concepts
that humans can easily comprehend, such as medical records, notes, notebooks,
calendars, and financial records.

For applications that operate on more complex and interconnected resources,
Shape Trees express the layout of those resources and associate them with
their respective shapes.
